Manage expense and revenue accruals from pickings
=================================================

This module generates expense and revenue accruals based on the status of pickings.

For revenue accruals, Odoo will take into account all the delivery orders in *Delivered* state that have been shipped before the cut-off date with *Invoice Control* = *Invoiced* with an invoice date after the cut-off date or *Invoice Control* = *To Be Invoiced*.

For expense accruals, OpenERP will take into account all the incoming shipments in *Received* state that have been received before the cut-off date with *Invoice Control* = *Invoiced* with an invoice date after the cut-off date or *Invoice Control* = *To Be Invoiced*.

The current code of the module only works when:

* on sale orders, the *Create Invoice* field is set to *On Delivery Order* ;
* for purchase orders, the *Invoicing Control* field is set to *Based on incoming shipments*.
